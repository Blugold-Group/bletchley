# Todo
# Provides a simple tracker for the progress of tasks for the codebase. []s provide the size/difficulty of the task on a scale of 1[x] (easiest) through 5 [xxxxx] (hardest)

# The ~options underneath tasks are requirements to finish the tasks (optional)


Backlog
    - Build lightbulb ML analysis system [xxxxx]

    - Add more ciphers to ciphers.py[xx]

    - Test and adapt stats.py[xx]

    - Organize (standardize naming and format) and define wordlists better (in the readme)[xxx]
        ~ Requires a knowledge of how the wordlists are used, and what format would be most efficient

    - Add support for piping in data from the cli[?]

    - Build usage documentation[xx]

    - Make the realTest in ciphers.py able to separate by other characters, for example separating the words of this_is_a_text [xx]

    - Make the realTest in ciphers.py able to separate by no characters, for example separating the words of thisisatext [xxxx]

    - In bruteforce.py, make tolerance not a global variable, passed in better

    - In bruteforce.py, write standard function for comparing a list of possible ciphertexts

    - Add or handle keys not coprime with 26 (invalid) for multiplication cipher

    - Add nonsense cipher (https://github.com/berzerk0/NonsenseCipher) [xxx]

    - Add tolerance to brute forcing methods [xxx]

    - Add better methods for vigenere automatic solving [xxxxx]
        ~ Right now it's brute forcing, but longer texts could use things like the Kasiski examination for elegance points

    - Make realtest able to receive and store tolerance when creating the object at instantiation [xx]

    - Add stuff for python linters, input and outputs params for functions and file descriptions [x]
        ~ You just need to understand the linter definitions (easy to learn) and basics of how the functions work
        ~ Focus on ciphers classes in ciphers.py

    - Add Engima to ciphers, uses pyengima [xx]

    - Add to readme documentation [x]
