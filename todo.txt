# Todo
# Provides a simple tracker for the progress of tasks for the codebase. []s provide the size/difficulty of the task on a scale of 1[x] (easiest) through 5 [xxxxx] (hardest)

# The ~options underneath tasks are requirements to finish the tasks (optional)


Backlog
    - Build lightbulb ML analysis system [xxxxx]

    - Add more ciphers to ciphers.py[xx]

    - Test and adapt stats.py[xx]

    - Organize (standardize naming and format) and define wordlists better (in the readme)[xxx]
        ~ Requires a knowledge of how the wordlists are used, and what format would be most efficient

    - Add support for piping in data from the cli[?]

    - Build usage documentation[xx]

    - Make the realTest in ciphers.py able to separate by other characters, for example separating the words of this_is_a_text [xx]

    - Make the realTest in ciphers.py able to separate by no characters, for example separating the words of thisisatext [xxxx]

    - In bruteforce.py, make tolerance not a global variable, passed in better

    - In bruteforce.py, write standard function for comparing a list of possible ciphertexts

    - Add or handle keys not coprime with 26 (invalid) for multiplication cipher
     

In Progress
    - Build start.py[xxxx]
        ~ Build cryptographically efficient method
    
    - Make cli modern and fancy[xx]
