# Bletchley

A Ciphersuite 

Bletchley has a number of tools to help in cryptanalysis, including

1. Frequency analysis
2. Automatic recognition and attempted decryption of various weak ciphers, including
    - Ceaser
    - Vigenere
    - Rot13
    - Enigma
    - Atbash
    - Playfair
    - Rot13
    - Affine
    - Baconian
    - Rail-Fence
    - Substitution Cipher
    - Columnar Transposition Cipher
    - Autokey Cipher
    - Beaufort Cipher
    - Porta Cipher
    - Running Key Cipher
    - Homophonic Substitution Cipher
    - Four Square Cipher
    - Hill Cipher
    - ADFGVX Cipher
    - ADFGX Cipher
    - Bifid Cipher
    - Trifid Cipher
    - Straddle Checkerboard Cipher 

    Also, basic encodings such as 
    - Base32
    - Base64
    - ASCII85

    Can also recognize the following, but cannot decrypt them
    - MD5
    - SHA-1
    - RIPEMD-160
    - Whirlpool
    - SHA2-224
    - SHA2-256
    - SHA2-384
    - SHA2-512
    - SHA3-224
    - SHA3-256
    - SHA3-384
    - SHA3-512
    - SHAKE128
    - SHAKE256


3. A static tool which tests a ciphertext for the above ciphers



Find what the plaintexts are likely to be, probably mostly quotes from GoodReads or something. 

Encrypt lots of plaintexts with various algorithms, and ML it to detect what cipher was used




The quotes database used to train the models are credited to

Madadipouya, Kasra. (2016). CSV dataset of 76,000 quotes, suitable for quotes recommender systems or other analysis.. 10.13140/RG.2.1.4386.4561.
