Provides utilities to en/decode a string with a number of encoding standards

by design, the tool supports many encodings, including obscure encodings

The tools also support en/decoding a string multiple times with either the same of different standards

For example 'encodedstringhere' can be decoded by base64 eight times, or decoded with base64 then base32 then base32 then base64
